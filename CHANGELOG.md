## [0.4.0] - 2024-10-27

### Added

- An extra system check was added to prevent misconfiguration of `OTP_WEBAUTHN_SUPPORTED_COSE_ALGORITHMS` ([#27](https://github.com/Stormbase/django-otp-webauthn/pull/27) by [Stormheg](https://github.com/Stormheg))

### Fixed

- Explicitly define `AllowAny` permission class for API views ([#19](https://github.com/Stormbase/django-otp-webauthn/pull/19) by [nijel](https://github.com/nijel))
- Make `WebAuthnCredentialManager` inherit from `DeviceManager` ([#23](https://github.com/Stormbase/django-otp-webauthn/pull/23) by [nijel](https://github.com/nijel))
- Clarify `username_field_selector` example in README ([#20](https://github.com/Stormbase/django-otp-webauthn/pull/20) by [nijel](https://github.com/nijel))
- Clarify custom credential model usage instructions ([#26](https://github.com/Stormbase/django-otp-webauthn/pull/26) by [jmichalicek](https://github.com/jmichalicek))
- Avoid logging None as exception in the py_webauthn exception rewriter ([#28](https://github.com/Stormbase/django-otp-webauthn/pull/28) by [nijel](https://github.com/nijel))
- A crash during Passkey registration was fixed when custom list of supported algorithms was used ([#27](https://github.com/Stormbase/django-otp-webauthn/pull/27) by [Stormheg](https://github.com/Stormheg))
- You can now call `as_credential_descriptors` on a queryset of `WebAuthnCredential` objects ([#27](https://github.com/Stormbase/django-otp-webauthn/pull/27) by [Stormheg](https://github.com/Stormheg))

### Changed

- The custom `__str__` representation for `WebAuthnCredential` is removed because displaying a AAGUID is not a friendly representation.

- The default `ModelAdmin` for `WebAuthnCredential` credential is no longer automatically registered. ([#27](https://github.com/Stormbase/django-otp-webauthn/pull/27) by [Stormheg](https://github.com/Stormheg))

  - You can instead register it manually in your `admin.py` file

    ```python
    # admin.py
    from django.contrib import admin
    from django_otp_webauthn.admin import WebAuthnCredentialAdmin
    from django_otp_webauthn.models import WebAuthnCredential

    admin.site.register(WebAuthnCredential, WebAuthnCredentialAdmin)
    ```

  - **Action required:** add `django_otp_webauthn.backends.WebAuthnBackend` to your `AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS` setting if you want to use passwordless login.

## [0.1.3] - 2024-07-01

### Added

- The default manager for the `WebAuthnCredential` model now includes a `as_credential_descriptors` method to make it easier to format the credentials for use in custom implementations.

### Fixed

- A bug was fixed with Python 3.11 and older that caused an exception when authenticating with a WebAuthn credential. ([#6](https://github.com/Stormbase/django-otp-webauthn/pull/6) by [jmichalicek](https://github.com/jmichalicek))

### Changed

- The `http://localhost:8000` default value for `OTP_WEBAUTHN_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` was removed.

## [0.1.2] - 2024-06-12

### Fixed

- The helper classes' `get_credential_display_name` and `get_credential_name` methods are now correctly called. Previously, the users' full name was being used as the credential name, bypassing above methods.

### Changed

- Set discoverable credential policy to `required` at registration time when `OTP_WEBAUTHN_ALLOW_PASSWORDLESS_LOGIN` is set to `True`. This is to ensure a credential capable of passwordless login is created.

### New

- Make is easier to override the helper class using the new `OTP_WEBAUTHN_HELPER_CLASS` setting. Pass it a dotted path to your custom helper class and it will be used instead of the default one.

## [0.1.1] - 2024-05-26

### Fixed

- An issue with the button label not showing any text was fixed.

### Changed

- `WebAuthnCredential` now inherits from `django_otp.models.TimestampMixin` to add a `created_at` and `last_used_at` fields. Subsequently, this raises the minimum `django-otp` version to `1.4.0+`.

### Maintenance

- Switch to [`hatch`](https://hatch.pypa.io/) for managing the project.

## [0.1.0] - 2024-05-12

- Initial release.
